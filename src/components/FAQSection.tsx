    question: "How do you guarantee 40+ hours/week in savings?",
    answer: "We map every manual step in your current process, quantify the time spent, and build automation that eliminates repetitive work. If we can't document at least 40 hours of weekly manual effort that we can automate, you don't pay for the Deep Dive."
  },
  {
    question: "What if our systems are too unique or complex?",
    answer: "We've worked with everything from legacy ERPs to custom-built platforms. The beauty of automation is that it bridges incompatible systems. If your data exists somewhere, we can work with it. During the Deep Dive, we'll map your specific setup and show you exactly how we'll connect the pieces."
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly will we see results?",
    answer: "Most clients see immediate time savings as soon as we deploy the first automation. Full implementation takes 4-8 weeks depending on scope. You'll have working prototypes within the first 2 weeks, and we deploy in phases so you're never waiting for everything at once."
